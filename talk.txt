Slide 1:
Hello, my name is John Hossler. I wanted to put together this talk in order to spread awareness of a topic that I care about very much. In this talk, I hope I I give someone new information or a new perspective on the topic of Net Neutrality.
Slide 2:
Some of you might be wondering what this topic <b>even is</b>. Well, the key idea is that all data must be treated the same by both the government and Internet Service Providers (ISPs). This idea has been broken down into three smaller ideas that protect the general idea: No blocking, No throttling, and No Paid Prioritization.
Down 1:
No blocking is what prohibits the blocking of legal data and the connection of non-harmful devices. This means I can buy my own modem made by a third party and use it to connect to my ISP. It also means I can use Peer to peer services, such as bittorrent, to spread or get legal content. This protects both the right to send and receive such traffic.
Down 2:
No throttling is definitely related to no blocking, but it's harder, as a consumer, to understand what is happening. If I try to access a service online and it's really slow and hard to use, my first instinct is to assume fault with the service and then move on to another service. The dangerous part about this is that it allows ISPs to artificially move the market towards services that directly make them more money. This is extremely anti-competitive behavior, and I think the only damage done is to the consumer; however, I do see a legitimate purpose of throttling -- it can be used to regulate network traffic and minimize bandwidth congestion, which benefits the consumer.
Down 3:
No Paid Prioritization is where I found the most conflict with my personal opinion. The idea behind it is that broadband providers may favor some traffic over other traffic in exchange for 'consideration' (for example, money). This blocks fastlanes created by ISPs. The key to this point is keeping it context with the central idea of Net Neutrality: all data must be treated the same by .. ISPs. I am completely in favor of me, as a consumer, being able to prioritize youtube traffic while I'm watching youtube, and later prioritizing Netflix or some music streaming service. The issue I have with paid prioritization is ISPs choosing what is prioritized for me, and is why it is mentioned. All three of these ideas are closely related to each other: Prioritization necessitates throttling of some kind and throttling is softer but less transparent form of blocking. This is why I do not think you can partially support Net Neutrality.
Slide 3:
Another key element of this discussion is understanding the role of Title II in protecting Net Neutrality.
